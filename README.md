# Blog Post Promoter

> Work in Progress

I want to syndicate my blog posts on https://dev.to next to being published on my own blog, but I don't want to do this manually.
I found that DEV.to has a public API in beta, so I want to use that to automatically publish and update my blog posts on DEV.to.

I also want that the Front Matter of my blog posts get updated accordingly.
